## 🧠  Overview & Key Concepts

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to essential Machine Learning algorithms and techniques. It covers the full lifecycle of model development—from data preprocessing to model optimization—with a focus on understanding the mathematical foundations behind the code.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Regression Models:** Implementations of **Linear**, **Multiple**, and **Non-linear Regression** to predict continuous variables, alongside **Logistic Regression** for binary classification tasks.
* **Classification & Clustering:** Exploration of distance-based algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and an introduction to **Unsupervised** and **Self-supervised** learning paradigms.
* **Model Optimization & Math:** A deep dive into **Gradient Descent** for minimizing loss functions and understanding statistical relationships through **Covariance**.
* **Data Handling:** Best practices for **Preprocessing** (handling **Missing Values**) and splitting datasets into **Train, Validation, and Test** sets to ensure robust performance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous testing using **Cross-Validation** to assess generalization.
* **Bias & Variance:** Detailed analysis of the **Bias-Variance Trade-off**, strategies to detect and mitigate **Overfitting** and **Underfitting**, and techniques to balance model complexity.
