    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data (or experience) rather than being explicitly programmed with fixed rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "![What is Machine Learning Diagram](images/what-is-machine-learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![ML Goal Function Diagram](images/ml-goal-function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of machine learning is to **automatically learn a function** that maps inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\hat{f}(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ → Input data (a D-dimensional feature vector)\n",
    "- $\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ → Predicted output (a K-dimensional vector, e.g., class probabilities or regression values)\n",
    "- $\\hat{f}: \\mathbb{R}^D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^K$ → The learned function (our best approximation of the true underlying mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually coding rules, we train the model on many **input-output examples**, allowing it to discover patterns and generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Input-Output Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input (x)                          | Desired Output (y)      |\n",
    "|------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| Image of a handwritten digit \"3\"   | 3                        |\n",
    "| House features (size, rooms, location) | House price             |\n",
    "| Audio waveform                     | Text transcript          |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Teaching a child to identify cats:\n",
    "- You don't provide a list of rules (\"must have fur, tail, whiskers...\").\n",
    "- You show hundreds of examples labeled \"cat\" or \"not cat\".\n",
    "- The child learns the underlying pattern and can recognize cats in new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning follows the same principle — learning directly from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically discovers complex patterns that are difficult or impossible to code manually\n",
    "- Performance improves with more data\n",
    "- Enables accurate predictions on new inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## In One Sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming.**\n"
