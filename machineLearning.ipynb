    "# What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data (or experience) rather than being explicitly programmed with fixed rules.\n",
    "\n",

    "![ML Goal Function Diagram](images/ml-goal-function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of machine learning is to **automatically learn a function** that maps inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\hat{f}(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ → Input data (a D-dimensional feature vector)\n",
    "- $\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ → Predicted output (a K-dimensional vector, e.g., class probabilities or regression values)\n",
    "- $\\hat{f}: \\mathbb{R}^D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^K$ → The learned function (our best approximation of the true underlying mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually coding rules, we train the model on many **input-output examples**, allowing it to discover patterns and generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Input-Output Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Input (x)                          | Desired Output (y)      |\n",

    "| House features (size, rooms, location) | House price             |\n",
    "| Audio waveform                     | Text transcript          |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Teaching a child to identify cats:\n",
    "- You don't provide a list of rules (\"must have fur, tail, whiskers...\").\n",
    "- You show hundreds of examples labeled \"cat\" or \"not cat\".\n",
    "- The child learns the underlying pattern and can recognize cats in new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning follows the same principle — learning directly from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically discovers complex patterns that are difficult or impossible to code manually\n",
    "- Performance improves with more data\n",
    "- Enables accurate predictions on new inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## In One Sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming.**\n"

    "\n",
    "## 1. Classification Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to assign an input to one of **K discrete categories/classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",

    "- $\\hat{y} \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, K\\}$ → Predicted class label\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- **Binary Classification** (K=2): Spam detection (Spam / Not Spam), Email classification\n",
    "- **Multi-class Classification**: Handwritten digit recognition (0–9), Image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns **decision boundaries** in the feature space to separate different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sequence-to-Sequence Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "A special type of classification where both input and output are **sequences** (variable length).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- **Machine Translation**: Input = sentence in one language → Output = sentence in another language\n",
    "- **Speech Recognition**: Input = audio waveform → Output = text transcript\n",
    "\n",
    "The model transforms one sequence into another (often of different length).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Regression Problems\n",
