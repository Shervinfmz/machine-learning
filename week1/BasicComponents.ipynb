    "# Datasets and Learning Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset is a collection of examples (data points or samples) containing input-output mappings that the model aims to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dataset Overview](images/dataset-overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each example consists of:\n",
    "  - **Input** `x`: a feature vector (measurements/attributes)\n",
    "  - **Output** `ŷ`: the desired target (label or value) — only available in supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inputs are typically organized into a **Feature Matrix** `X`:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  X = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  x_{11} & x_{12} & \\dots & x_{1D} \\\\\n",
    "  x_{21} & x_{22} & \\dots & x_{2D} \\\\\n",
    "  \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "  x_{N1} & x_{N2} & \\dots & x_{ND}\n",
    "  \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "  \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "  X = [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `N` = number of samples\n",
    "  - `D` = number of features (dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature** is a measurable property or attribute relevant to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classic Example: Iris Dataset** (Classification of 3 iris flower species)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Iris Features](images/features-iris.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width\n",
    "- Dataset size: 150 samples → $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{150 \\times 4}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training and Test Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "![Training and Test Split](images/train-test-split.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Distribution](images/data-distribution.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We always split data into **at least two distinct sets**:\n",
    "  - **Training Dataset**: Used to learn the function `f(x)`\n",
    "  - **Test Dataset**: Used to evaluate performance after training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training and test examples **must be different**\n",
    "- Why? If the model sees test data during training, we **overestimate** its real-world performance (like giving a student the exam answers as homework!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions for Good Generalization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training and test samples are drawn from the **same underlying data distribution** $P_{data}$\n",
    "- Samples are **independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "![Supervised Learning](images/supervised-learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning = learning from **labeled** examples (both `x` and correct `y` are provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Covers both **classification** and **regression** problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix form:\n",
    "- Feature matrix: $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D}$\n",
    "- Target matrix: $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times K}$ (K = number of outputs/classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Supervised Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear models\n",
    "- Neural networks\n",
    "- Support vector machines\n",
    "- Naive Bayes\n",
    "- K-nearest neighbors\n",
    "- Random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning = learning from **unlabeled** data (only inputs `x` are available).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even without labels, we can discover useful structure in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering**  \n",
    "   Group similar data points together into clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Clustering Example](images/clustering-example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We detect \"close\" points and assign them to the same cluster.\n",
    "   - No predefined labels — clusters represent different types of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Density Estimation**  \n",
    "   Estimate the underlying data distribution $P_{data}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Density Estimation Example](images/density-estimation.png)  \n",
    "   - Learn how likely different points are.\n",
    "   - Useful for anomaly detection, generating new samples, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Matrix (same as supervised):**  \n",
    "$X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D}$ (no `Y` matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- Customer segmentation\n",
    "- Anomaly detection\n",
    "- Data compression (dimensionality reduction)\n",
    "- Preprocessing for supervised tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning (Brief Overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Reinforcement Learning](images/reinforcement-learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- No fixed labeled dataset\n",
    "- Learning by **interaction** with an environment\n",
    "- Agent takes **actions** → receives **rewards/penalties**\n",
    "- Goal: Maximize cumulative reward\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- Game playing (AlphaGo)\n",
    "- Robotics\n",
    "- Self-driving cars\n",
    "- Drug discovery\n",
