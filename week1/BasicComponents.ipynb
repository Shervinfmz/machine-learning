    "\n",
    "A dataset is a collection of examples (data points or samples) containing input-output mappings that the model aims to learn.\n",

    "![Dataset Overview](images/dataset-overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each example consists of:\n",
    "  - **Input** `x`: a feature vector (measurements/attributes)\n",
    "  - **Output** `ŷ`: the desired target (label or value) — only available in supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inputs are typically organized into a **Feature Matrix** `X`:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  X = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "### What is a Feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature** is a measurable property or attribute relevant to the problem.\n",

    "## Machine Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning **algorithm** is a procedure that finds a function $\\hat{f}$ mapping inputs to outputs:\n",

    "The algorithm does **not** search all possible functions in the universe. Instead, it searches within a restricted set called the **hypothesis space** $\\mathcal{H}$.\n",
