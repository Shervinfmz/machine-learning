    "# Machine Learning Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical machine learning workflow consists of three main stages: **Training**, **Test (Evaluation)**, and **Inference (Production)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Machine Learning Stages Overview](images/ml-stages-overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Three Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training**  \n",
    "   - Use a **training set** (labeled data) to learn a function `f(x)` that explains the training data well.\n",
    "   - Goal: Find the best model parameters that map inputs `x` to correct outputs `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test (Evaluation)**  \n",
    "   - Evaluate the trained model on a separate **test set** (data never seen during training).\n",
    "   - Goal: Measure how well the model **generalizes** to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inference (Production)**  \n",
    "   - Deploy the final trained model to make predictions on new real-world data (no labels available).\n",
    "   - This is the actual use of the model in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Cat vs Dog Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the stages using a simple binary classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Training (Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Training Phase - Cat vs Dog](images/cat-dog-training.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We collect a **training set** with images (`x`) and corresponding labels (`y`): \"Cat\" or \"Dog\".\n",
    "- We feed these input-output pairs to the machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "- The algorithm learns a function `f(x)` that tries to correctly predict the label for each training image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: The model should \"explain well\" the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Test (Evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Test Phase - Correct and Incorrect](images/cat-dog-test.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a separate **test set** (new images not used in training).\n",
    "- The model predicts labels for these images.\n",
    "- We compare predictions with true labels to measure performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concept: **Generalization**  \n",
    "A good model performs well on unseen data (not just memorizing the training set).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Evaluation\n",
    "Suppose we test on 4 images:\n",
    "- 3 correct predictions ✓\n",
    "- 1 incorrect ✗\n",
    "\n",
    "Test accuracy:\n",
    "$$\\text{Accuracy (\\%)} = \\frac{N_{\\text{correct}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} \\times 100 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Inference (Production)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Inference Phase](images/cat-dog-inference.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once satisfied with performance, we deploy the model.\n",
    "- New images come in (no labels known).\n",
    "- The model predicts \"Cat\" or \"Dog\" in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference** = running the trained model on live/unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how ML powers apps like:\n",
    "- Photo tagging\n",
    "- Spam filters\n",
    "- Medical diagnosis tools\n",
    "- Self-driving cars\n",
